**Frontend**

The goal was to bring all of these together to complete an independent project that was created, designed and built out by me.

## Project Description 

The First Step was a project designed to create a space and community around those faced with struggles of addiction. The whole idea is to maintain anonymity for the users, meaning there are no true user profiles, no bios, no pictures and no follows. This was decided to encourage users to post their stories on the community page where all can see and benefit from.

## The User Experince
As a user, you can sign in with your username and password - or create an account with a email, username and password. Once signed up or signed in, you are brought to the homepage. Here you are greeted with a welcome message and a inspirational quote of the day. 

Once logged in, you can also then select the 'Community Feed' link. This is where users can filter through post if they are looking for a specific topics and guidance, or just scroll through the post to see what the community is saying.

You also have abilty to not only create your own post, but also leave comments on others post to further open up dicussions and words of support and encouragement. A user can create a post by using the 'Your Post' link in the navbar, and selecting the 'create post' button. Once created, this is then pushed to the community feed.

There is a 'Resource' link as well that provides links to helpfull organizations and support systems dedicated to particluar struggles. These links were designed to be useful for those personally struggling with any type of addiction, or for those being indirectly impacted by addiction (such as freinds, family or loved ones)
